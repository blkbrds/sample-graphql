IOS MVVM Project Boilerplate
============================

> Looking for MVC boilerplate? [Click here](https://github.com/asiantechinc/at-boilerplate-ios-mvc).

*Every app we build is unique, but best practices should be consistent between projects. Here on [AsianTech](http://asiantech.vn) iOS team, we’ve been baking more and more of those best practices into a template we use for starting any new project.
This ensures consistency in our work: we don’t repeat mistakes, we use known libraries that we all have some experience with, and any one of us can get up to speed on a new project quickly because things are organized in a way we recognize.*

## Prerequisites

- [MacOS Sierra (10.12.x)](https://www.apple.com/lae/macos/sierra/)
- [Xcode 8.3.x](https://developer.apple.com/download/)
- [CocoaPods 1.2.x](https://cocoapods.org/#install)

**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, I recommend to watch
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

## Project Structure

| Name                               | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Define**/passport.js             | Passport Local and OAuth strategies, plus login middleware.  |

**Note:** There is no preference how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Or, if you prefer to use `yarn` instead of `npm`
yarn install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

## Obtaining the Defines

To use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new credentials.

> I have included dummy keys for all API examples to get you up and running even faster. But don't forget to update
them with *your credentials* when you are ready to deploy an app.
